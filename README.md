## Hello world ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael, a web developer with a deep passion for everything the web has to offer. I thrive on working with open-source technologies, enjoy the power and flexibility of Unix, and use modern frameworks to craft bespoke websites, online stores, and full-stack projects. My focus is on delivering user-friendly and functional solutions that not only stand out technically but also provide an exceptional user experience.

For me, web development is more than just a profession â€“ it's a true love for the art of digital craftsmanship.

I'm always open to fresh ideas and exciting new challenges!
